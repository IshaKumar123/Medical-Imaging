The classical FCM is sensitive to noise and the objective function often gets trapped in local optima. In this work, we have combined FCM with various optimization techniques to find the optimum cluster centres. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Firefly, Cuckoo and Simulated Annealing (SA) are the widely used optimization techniques in segmentation as well as for classification problems. Here we are proposing the Crow Search (CS) Optimization for the image segmentation using FCM. The CS optimization was found to produce satisfactory and promising results when compared with ABC, Firefly, Cuckoo and SA algorithm in the segmentation of abdomen CT images using FCM. In addition, a thorough investigation has been made in choosing the appropriate validation functions for the clustering techniques. The algorithms have been developed in Matlab 2015a and tested on CT abdomen datasets. Finally, the hardware implementation of FCM-CS algorithm was done in Raspberry Pi B+ model embedded board.
